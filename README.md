# CodeAlpha_Number_Guessing_Game

I developed Simple Number Guessing Game using C++

This program implements a simple Number Guessing Game where the computer randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback, telling the player whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. 
- The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player inputs a guess, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The number of attempts is tracked and displayed when the player guesses the number correctly.
- The player can choose to play multiple rounds by answering 'y' or 'Y' when asked if they want to play again.
